## Overview

ECLIPSA is an interactive fluid art generator that allows you to create mesmerizing, dynamic artwork directly in your browser. Using particle-based physics and fluid dynamics, ECLIPSA transforms your mouse or touch movements into flowing, colorful visualizations.

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing**: Create fluid art by clicking and dragging across the canvas
- **Multiple Color Palettes**: Choose from 9 different color schemes including Vibrant, Earth tones, Neon, Rainbow, and more
- **Physics Effects**: Apply gravity, wind, turbulence, and vortex effects to your artwork
- **Pattern Generator**: Generate automatic patterns like spirals, waves, starbursts, grids, and fractals
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust physics strength, pattern density, speed, and size
- **Save Your Artwork**: Download your creations as PNG images
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## How to Use

1. **Select a Color**: Click on one of the color palette buttons in the top-right corner
2. **Draw**: Click and drag on the canvas to create fluid effects
3. **Add Physics**: Click the lightning bolt icon to open physics controls

5. **Reset Canvas**: Click the reset button to clear your artwork
6. **Save Image**: Click the download button to save your artwork as a PNG

## Physics Effects

- **Gravity**: Particles fall downward with adjustable strength
- **Wind**: Horizontal force that changes over time
- **Turbulence**: Random, swirling motion for chaotic effects
- **Vortex**: Creates a spinning effect around your cursor

## Pattern Types

- **Spiral**: Creates spiraling particle formations
- **Wave**: Generates wave-like patterns across the canvas
- **Starburst**: Radiates particles outward from a central point
- **Grid**: Creates a grid of particles with subtle movement
- **Fractal**: Generates recursive, branch-like structures

## Technical Details

ECLIPSA is built with:
- React and Next.js for the UI framework
- HTML Canvas API for rendering
- Custom particle physics system
- Tailwind CSS for styling
